# Function Description
## The dodraw Function as in game01.py

The dodraw function draws all of the game display using the pyGame library.
First it fills the window surface white then it draws the entire tile map and
finally the player sprite.
The other items and monsters are drawn as separate surface layers in other methods.

The tile map is drawn by iterating through two for loops each for the rows respectivally
the columns of the map:

> for y in range(MAPHEIGHT):
>     for x in range(MAPWIDTH):
>         gameDisplay.blit(img[int(tilemap[y][x])], (TILESIZE*x,TILESIZE*y))
