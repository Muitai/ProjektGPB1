Description:

  This project in development (as of Nov. 2018) is a small RPG based on top-down tile graphics (Ã  la Ultima). It features smooth player 
  and monster movements on a non-scrolling map made of simple tile graphics. The combat system is hack&slay style action. This project is 
  being realised with the pyGame-library.
  
Release Note 30.11.2018:

  As of now we have implemented a simple monster spawn system and smooth player movements which simple dummy graphics for everything.
